<h1>Rick Sanchez</h1>
<!--general info start-->
<p><strong><a href="#">Richard "Rick" Sanchez</a></strong>, also known as <strong>Rick (C-137)</strong>, is
    one of the titular two main
    protagonists (alongside Morty
    Smith) of Rick and Morty.

    He is a megagenius scientist whose alcoholism and reckless, nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his
    "daughter's" family, as well as the safety of their son, <a
            href="http://localhost:63342/Oktenschool/HW2/page2.html?_ijt=96n8hip0qas4q11s8lbdb4mqsu&_ij_reload=RELOAD_ON_SAVE">Morty</a
    >.
    Upon the series' inception, Rick's mysterious
    origins and mental health were large sources of speculation. As time has gone on, more has been revealed about his
    character, his backstory explaining much of his behaviour. At the same time, Rick has continuously committed more
    heinous acts, certifying him as the series' anti-hero, bordering on antagonist.</p>

<h2 class="a">Biography</h2>
<p>While Rick's backstory remained shrouded in mystery for much of the series, it's clear that he always had a knack for
    science and invention, being able to rewire and fix a television around the age of 12. It wasn't until "Rickmurai
    Jack" where Rick's past is finally shown in great detail. The "totally fabricated" backstory shown in "The Rickshank
    Rickdemption" was mostly based on the truth and further hinted at in "Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort".
    Prior to the beginning of the series, Rick had a fairly normal middle-class childhood and had developed an interest
    in tinkering with things at a young age. As an adult, he married a woman named Diane and they had a daughter, Beth.
    Rick eventually became a scientist who was struggling to invent teleportation. One day, he was visited by an
    alternate version of himself, who offered him the ability to travel to different realities, but Rick refused.
    Angered by this, the other Rick sent a bomb through a portal, possibly attempting to kill Rick C-137, but instead
    killed Diane and Beth. Rick grieved for an unknown period of time, before inventing his own portal gun and going on
    a quest for revenge.</p>

<p>Rick would spend the next few decades searching for the Rick who murdered his family. He eventually became a weapons
    dealer, trying to find parts for a device to help him track down the one who killed his family. Rick eventually met
    Birdperson at a festival, and formed rock band called "The Flesh Curtains" together with Squanchy. The three
    eventually formed the core of the resistance against the Galactic Federation, culminating in the Battle of Blood
    Ridge. After winning the battle, Rick offered Birdperson the chance to join him in his adventures throughout the
    multiverse, but when Birdperson refused. Hurt by this, Rick left to continue his quest for revenge, hoping to
    eventually find someone more agreeable to join him on his adventures.</p>

<p>During this time, Rick murdered several of his alternate selves, all of which belonged to an unknown organization of
    Ricks, yet none of them were the one Rick he was searching for. At this point, Rick had become depressed after
    failing to find his family's murderer and often used alcohol to numb his constant mental anguish. Eventually, the
    other Ricks banded together to try and stop the so-called "Rickest Rick". However, even this proved to be futile and
    Rick, yet again, murdered most of the alliance set on taking him down. Because of his unstoppable nature, the other
    Ricks eventually admitted defeat to Rick C-137, acknowledging him as their leader. This would lead to the
    construction of the Citadel of Ricks as part of their truce. Rick himself oversaw the construction process, but he
    soon left after it was built due to how the other Ricks wanted to run it, leaving it to be run by the Council of
    Ricks. Shortly after, Rick crashed into the house of Beth Smith, a version of his daughter who never died, who
    believed this Rick to be her original absent father, and inserted himself into the family. This, of course, lead to
    the start of the series, where Rick has supposedly returned from his 20 year long absence.</p>
<p>As of now, Rick is about 70 years old and currently resides in his room in the Smith house. He also uses the garage
    as partial living quarters. In the garage, he works on his inventions and science - for example, traveling to other
    dimensions, building various robots and devices, and causing general mayhem in different parts of the universe, be
    it dimensions, planets, or alternate realities. A notable aspect of Rick's development is that as the series has
    progressed, Rick's god-like status has been moved to the forefront of the story. Many characters refer to him as the
    smartest man in the universe, whilst he himself has called himself a god and demonstrated his unstoppable
    nature</p>

<!--Criminal Record start-->
<h2 class="a">Criminal Record</h2>
<p>Throughout his numerous adventures with Morty, Rick has been shown to be ready and willing to disregard rules, laws
    and social norms if it is necessary to complete a task or escape a dangerous situation. Season one has Rick
    resorting to assault, battery, vandalism, smuggling, corruption of a minor, home invasion, reckless endangerment,
    terrorist threats, indecent exposure and even murder and arson in order to get the job done. The most common crimes
    committed are driving (or flying, in Rick's case) under the influence, drug abuse, and public intoxication.

    In "The Wedding Squanchers," Rick is arrested by the Galactic Federation. His full criminal record is displayed on a
    monitor. Although in an alien language and unreadable, it is shown to be quite long. After he is placed under
    maximum security, another prisoner asks him "What are you in for?", to which Rick responds simply with "Everything".
    In "Mort Dinner Rick Andre", Rick is arrested by the police, though they were under the control of Mr. Nimbus.</p>
<ul class="b">
    <li><b>Assault:</b> In the episode A Rickle in Time, Rick started beating up a member of the Galactic Federation.
        Also in
        the pilot episode, Rick slaps a bystander alien in the face while fleeing from airport security, causing the
        alien to cry.
    </li>
    <li><b>Bioterrorism:</b> In the episode Rick Potion #9, Rick made a dysfunctional love potion that spread a flu-like
        virus
        to everyone in the world, which he tried to fix by making another virus including praying mantis DNA that caused
        them to rip apart and mutate into giant praying mantis monsters. He attempted to fix this, by using another
        potion, but this only made them mutate again, cronenberging the entire world. He couldn't fix the mutations in
        the end, and just left the dimension with Morty, leaving all of the mutated humans behind.
    </li>
    <li><b>Breaking and Entering (Burglary):</b> In the episode Lawnmower Dog, Rick and Morty snuck into Mr.
        Goldenfold's house
        while he was sleeping with the intent to brainwash him into giving Morty an A in math by invading Mr.
        Goldenfold's his dreams and incepting the idea.
    </li>
    <li><b>Cable Piracy:</b> In the episodes Rixty Minutes and Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate, Rick used an
        interdimensional cable box to stream an infinite amount of TV channels to his own television and the
        intergalactic hospital television.
    </li>
    <li><b>Child Abuse:</b> In most episodes of the series, Rick takes Morty along with him on all of his adventures,
        sometimes
        against his will. He often endangers his life as well as leaving him traumatized and mentally scarred by
        exposing him to scary and horrible things, such as watching himself get killed and having to bury his own body
        or being forced to kill clones of his family. Morty is also the victim of lots of physical damage such as
        breaking his legs in three places. In the episode "Total Rickall", Rick was even seen pushing Morty down a
        stairwell, simply as a practical joke, in a flashback montage, along with other ways Rick has mistreated him.
    </li>
    <li><b>Corpse Mutilation:</b> In "Pickle Rick", he ripped apart the bodies of multiple rats and cockroaches and
        reassembled
        them into a suit.
    </li>
    <li><b>Driving Under Influence:</b> Rick is drunk throughout the majority of most episodes of Rick and Morty and
        he's seen
        driving the space cruiser while he's drunk. Most notably in the Pilot episode, when Rick was visibly intoxicated
        while he flew the space cruiser with Morty and it almost led to him destroying the world.
    </li>
    <li><b>Felony Murder:</b> Through the course of their adventures, many people have died as a direct or indirect
        result of
        Rick's actions. These deaths were usually during the commission of various other serious crimes he was
        committing, including felony evasion, smuggling, fraud, etc. Rick has also induced Morty to kill people for him,
        such as making him shoot the security guards to aid their escape in the Pilot episode.
    </li>
    <li><b>Genocide:</b> In the episode The Ricks Must Be Crazy, in order to keep the inhabitants of the microverse
        producing
        power for his spaceship, Rick smashes the container of the Miniverse. This causes the Miniverse, and the
        Teenyverse (a miniature universe within the Miniverse), and its two races of inhabitants to be wiped from
        existence.
    </li>
    <li><b>Human Cloning:</b> In the episode Big Trouble In Little Sanchez, it was revealed that Rick had been cloning
        and
        growing other versions of himself in vats in his bunker under the Smith Family garage. Although it remains
        unclear where cloning fits into Intergalactic law, it is at least illegal on Earth. It is also revealed that he
        cloned Beth in "Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri". In "Rickmurai Jack" it is revealed he is aware of - and
        possibly involved with - the mass cloning of Mortys at the Citadel to serve as sidekicks to Ricks.
    </li>
    <li><b>Illegal Arms Dealing:</b> In the episode "Mortynight Run", it was revealed that Rick has been selling weapons
        to a
        hitman for a long time, possibly also hiring him to kill various living beings. During a flashback in "Rickmurai
        Jack", a younger Rick sold large shipments of weapons to aliens in exchange for technology.
    </li>
    <li><b>Impersonation:</b> When Rick's concoctions in the episode Rick Potion #9 mutated everyone on the planet not
        biologically related to Morty, the two traveled to a new dimension whose versions of them had just died in an
        explosion seconds before their arrival, and assumed their places as if nothing had happened. The corpses are
        currently still buried in the Smith's backyard. In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", he took control over the minds
        of many Gromflomites and members of SEAL Team Rick and pretended to be them.
    </li>
    <li><b>Kidnapping and False Imprisonment:</b> In the episode Auto Erotic Assimilation, it was revealed that Rick had
        kidnapped an alien and kept it imprisoned in the basement against its own will for an amount of time, so that he
        could perform multiple tests on him.
    </li>
    <li><b>Murder:</b> Outside of all of the hostile aliens he's killed, Rick has killed multiple innocent beings too.
        In the
        episode Big Trouble In Little Sanchez, he ran around with an axe and killed several living versions of himself
        at different ages, including a baby, a young child, a young adult, and a full adult (although this could also
        fall under suicide, since they were his own clones). In the episode The Wedding Squanchers, he killed a few more
        members of the Galactic Federation. In Look Who's Purging Now, Rick and Morty partake in the Purge, and Rick
        kills a large number of government officials, although this was in a successful effort to remove the Purge.
    </li>
    <li><b>Prison Escape</b> - In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", Rick broke out of the Galactic Federation Prison, killed
        many
        of the guards, and finally, blew the entire place up, which in turn, must have freed any other prisoners,
        assuming any survived the explosion.
    </li>
    <li><b>Slavery:</b> In the episode The Ricks Must Be Crazy, it was revealed that Rick's spaceship battery was
        powered
        through a microverse, containing a whole planet of people forced to generate his power (originally through
        deception, later through fear of destruction).
    </li>
    <li><b>Smuggling:</b> In the Pilot episode, Rick attempted to smuggle Mega Seeds past Intergalactic Customs
        security, by
        having Morty shove them up his butt to avoid the scanner detecting them. However, when the security guard told
        them they have a new machine that would detect things up there, Rick grabbed Morty and took off running from
        them.
    </li>
    <li><b>Terrorism:</b> At the end of the episode The Ricks Must Be Crazy, the inhabitants of the microverse are
        forced to
        step on gooble-boxes to power Rick's spaceship for fear of their planet being destroyed (see above: Slavery).
    </li>
    <li><b>Time Manipulation:</b> In the episode A Rickle in Time, Rick froze time for the equivalent of six months
        which
        caused time to start splitting and dividing multiple times, to the point where a Fourth Dimensional Being from
        the Galactic Federation came and tried to arrest him and his grandkids, also revealing that Rick may have done
        this before.
    </li>
    <li><b>Torture/Cruelty to Animals:</b> At the end of the episode Auto Erotic Assimilation, Rick revealed to be in
        possession a living, albeit frozen, being (unclear on the sentience of said being), which was horribly suffering
        after thawing out , and then he shocked it with a superheated ray, reducing it to ash. This was apparently to
        test the suicide machine he was using to end his own life.
    </li>
    <li><b>Vandalism/Arson:</b> Rick destroyed multiple things in Intergalactic Customs in the Pilot episode. In the
        episode
        Something Ricked This Way Comes, Rick had a store and soon got bored of it, so he doused it with gasoline and
        lit it on fire while people were still in it.
    </li>
    <li><b>Treason/Rebellion:</b> Prior to the start of the series, Rick was part of an organization that attempted to
        overthrow and destroy the Galactic Federation, along with his old comrades Squanchy and Birdperson.
    </li>
