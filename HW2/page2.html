<h1>Morty Smith</h1>
<!--general start-->
<p><strong><a href="#">Mortimer "Morty" Smith Sr.</a></strong> is one of the two titular main protagonists (alongside
  <a href="http://localhost:63342/Oktenschool/HW2/page1.html?_ijt=8d53e2vcauk4trrfv49t2rgubq&_ij_reload=RELOAD_ON_SAVE">Rick
    Sanchez</a>) of Rick and Morty.
  He is the grandson of Rick and is often forced to tag along on his various misadventures. Morty attends Harry
  Herpson High School along with his sister, Summer. At the beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an
  incredibly anxious and submissive teenage boy. However, after going on many so-called adventures with Rick, Morty
  has seemingly become more confident and his own person, independent from Rick, rather than a mere sidekick.</p>

<h2 class="a">Biography</h2>
<p>Currently, Morty is around 14 years old. He first met his grandfather, Rick Sanchez, when the latter moved into his
  home after supposedly being absent for 20 years. However, it was revealed that Rick is originally from Dimension
  C-137 and, after losing his wife and daughter, eventually moved into Morty's dimension to live with an adult version
  of Beth. However, curiously enough, it has been shown Rick knew Morty when he was a baby.</p>

<p>In "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind", one of Rick's happy memories of Morty was picking him up as a baby. In
  "Get Schwifty", a picture on Birdperson's wall depicted Rick holding a baby, who, although had an ambiguous
  identity, was very likely Morty. It was originally assumed these babies were our Morty, but the revelation that Rick
  only just met Morty shortly before the beginning of the series contradicts this. It's possible the baby Rick picked
  up was an alternate version of Morty or Rick dropped in on this version of the Smith (who resided within the
  Cronenberged Dimension; our Morty's original home) family to meet him before leaving once again.</p>

<p>In "Raising Gazorpazorp", Beth accidentally admitted that when Morty was a baby, Jerry filled Morty with his own
  insecurities, making him the anxious teenager we see in the series. In the pilot episode, Morty's parents insist
  that he has some sort of learning disability. Rick later states Morty's low intelligent masks Rick's high
  intelligence, acting as a camouflage that prevents Rick's incredible intelligence from being tracked.</p>

<p>In "Rickmurai Jack" it is revealed that most Mortys were bred at The Citadel in order to serve Ricks, as well as act
  as camouflage. Whilst it's never explicitly stated that our Morty was among the Mortys who were created at The
  Citadel, Rick alludes to it, telling Morty "Jeez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness." However, it was also
  shown that Ricks manipulated circumstances for different versions of Jerry and Beth to meet, which would lead to
  them conceiving Morty in the future. This could also mean Morty was born, but only via interference from the
  Citadel. Rick's aforementioned dialogue could contradict this second possibility.</p>

<p>Despite it being alluded to, it can be reasonably assumed Morty was not created at the Citadel and was instead born
  naturally. The Smith family all seem to have memories of Morty growing up in their home[10], including Morty's
  original family from the Cronenberged Dimension. This is noteworthy, as it appears that once grown at the Citadel,
  Mortys are immediately given to a Rick as a sidekick. This would also disprove Morty being born through interference
  by the Ricks, as this was only done to create more Mortys for the same purpose.</p>

<h2 class="a">Trivia</h2>
<ul class="b">
  <li>Morty's voice, and general appearance stemmed from an early Justin Roiland short entitled The Real Animated
    Adventures of Doc and Mharti, which was a parody of Back to the Future. Morty parodies Marty McFly from Back to
    the Future.
    <ul>
      <li>Another character named Marty with an appearance and voice completely identical to Morty's also appears
        in Justin Roiland's short Paloni Pitch Presentation. Another identical character named Pumpkinseeds and
        Peanuts, voiced by Andy Dick, appears in another short; The Unmarketables.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>He was deemed the "one true Morty" by the imprisoned Mortys in "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind".</li>
  <li>Morty is considered by Rick to be the "Morty-est" Morty.</li>
  <li>Since he helped conceive Morty Jr. in "Raising Gazorpazorp", this makes him Morty Smith, Sr.</li>
  <li>Prior to and during the series, Morty has a crush on his classmate Jessica. He was also attracted to Annie in
    "Anatomy Park" and started a relationship with her. In "Look Who's Purging Now", Morty has a crush on Arthricia.
  </li>
  <li>Morty masturbates frequently, and according to him, "everywhere". In "Something Ricked This Way Comes", Morty
    mentioned that he watches a lot of porn on his laptop and masturbates in his bedroom. In "Total Rickall", a
    flashback showed Morty masturbating while standing up on the kitchen table, while thinking about a hot friend of
    his sister's. In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy", while in an ultra-microscopic world, Morty mentioned that he
    masturbated to a curvy piece of driftwood.
  </li>
  <li>It was revealed in "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" that Rick modified Morty's DNA structure so he can transform into a
    car. However, Morty was unaware of this until Rick told him while they were chasing Zeep Xanflorp.
  </li>
  <li>Morty has a foot fetish. As heard in Mortynight Run, when Fart says "I communicate through what you call
    'Jessica's feet', no, 'Telepathy'." "Jessica's feet" was an excerpt from Morty's mind.
  </li>
  <li>In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", Morty's legal age, under Galactic Federation, became 35.</li>
  <li>Morty is agnostic.</li>
  <li>In "Mort Dinner Rick Andre," it is said that Rick had at least one known assistant (named Kyle) prior to
    Morty.
  </li>
  <li>As seen in "Mort Dinner Rick Andre" and said by Dan Harmon, Morty is starting to get tired of Rick's behavior
    and is getting more frustrated with his insults.
  </li>
  <li>In a sense, as of Season 3, he's the only remaining member of the original cast. His versions of Summer, Beth
    and Jerry were left behind in the 'Cronenberged' timeline, and are possibly dead after being frozen by the Rick
    squad that found Morty and Summer in "The Rickshank Rickdemption", while Rick himself has lost his original body
    and has transferred his consciousness to another Rick.
  </li>
  <li>Up until the Season 5 finale, Morty was under the impression he was from Dimension C-137, stating "I'm Morty
    C-137" to the imprisoned Mortys in "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind", and to the Council of Ricks in "The
    Rickshank Rickdemption." As confirmed in "Rickmurai Jack", Rick C-137 never had his own Smith family, and thus
    Morty's dimension is not Dimension C-137 as Morty first believed. It is unknown what number Morty's dimension is
    designated, though it is known as the Cronenberged Dimension.
